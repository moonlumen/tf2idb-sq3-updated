# tf2idb-sq3-updated
Updated tf2idb.sq3 file for older/legacy Sourcemod plugins, such as [TF2 Taunts TF2IDB](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=293722).

Also includes an updated Python file that works in Python 3.12. This was adapted from the, now archived, [TF2IDB](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2idb) repo.

***>>> You should absolutely only use this if [EconDataCompat](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconDataCompat) doesn't work for your server/plugin. <<<***
